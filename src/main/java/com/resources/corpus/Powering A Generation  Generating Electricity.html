Electrons</font></font></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are a many ways to produce electricity. Electrons 
        can flow between certain different materials providing a current, as in 
        a common battery. While reliable and portable, chemical batteries run 
        down quickly. To provide the large amounts of steady power demanded by 
        modern societies, large power plants have been built. Most power plants 
        make electricity with a machine called a generator.<a name="gen1"></a></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Generators have two important parts:
the rotor (which rotates) and the stator (which remains stationary). Generators
use the principle of electro-magnetic induction, which exploits the relation
between magnetism and electricity. In large AC generators, an outer shell
with powerful magnets rotates around a stationary &quot;armature&quot;
which is wound with heavy wire. As they move, the magnets induce an electric
current in the wire.</font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>It is important to recognize that electricity
is not mined or harvested, it must be manufactured. And since it's not
easily stored in quantity, it must be manufactured at time of demand. Electricity
is a form of energy, but not an energy source. Different generating plants
harness different energy sources to make electric power. The two most common
types are &quot;Thermal Plants&quot; and &quot;Kinetic Plants&quot;. </P></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+2>Thermal
Generating Plants</FONT></FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thermal plants use the energy of heat to make electricity. 
        Water is heated in a boiler until it becomes high-temperature steam. This 
        steam is then channeled through a turbine, which has many fan-blades attached 
        to a shaft. As the steam moves over the blades, it causes the shaft to 
        spin. This spinning shaft is connected to the rotor of a generator, and 
        the generator produces electricity.<a name="gen2"></a></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Fossil-fueled
plants</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Fossil-fuels are the remains of plant
and animal life that lived long ago. Exposed to high temperatures and pressures
for millions of years underground, these remains have been transformed
into forms of carbon: coal, oil, and natural gas. Unlike electricity itself,
fossil fuels can be stored in large quantities. After 100 years of research
and development, fossil-fueled plants are generally reliable, and problems
that do occur are usually confined to a local area. Many electric utilities
have operated fossil-fuel plants for decades, and these plants (now fully
paid for) are very profitable to run. This not only increases profits to
the utility, but keeps down the direct cost to users. </font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>However, fossil-fuel plants can create
serious environmental problems. Burning these fuels produces sulfur-dioxide
and nitric-oxide air-pollution requiring expensive scrubbers. Wastewater
from the used steam can carry pollutants into water-sheds. Even with very
good pollution controls, there is still waste material produced. Carbon-dioxide
gas, and ash are the current concerns.</P>

<P>Also, fossil-fuels are not renewable.
They took millions of years to make, and at some point they will run out.
Extracting and transporting them for use has created environmental problems.
Strip-mining of coal and oil-spills at sea can produce catastrophic impacts
on ecosystems.</P></FONT>
<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Cogeneration</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Oil has become too expensive for most
power plants. Coal and natural gas are currently cheap in the US, and are
being used more often. These two fuels are being used more efficiently
in &quot;cogeneration&quot; plants. Cogeneration is not a new idea, and
takes advantage of the way many large electricity users operate. Many factories
use steam in their production process. Utilities often make and sell steam
for these customers, as well as for running their own generators.</font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>Rather than simply condensing and exhausting
waste-steam after it has passed thru the turbine, &quot;top-cycle&quot;
cogenerators pipe this usable commodity to nearby customers. &quot;Bottom-cycle&quot;
cogenerators operate in reverse and use the waste steam from industrial
processing to drive turbines. By reusing steam, thermal-efficiency at cogeneration
plants can exceed 50%.</P>

<P>Recently developed cogeneration plants
use new materials and designs to improve reliability, and control both
thermal and atmospheric pollution. Since these new technologies are designed
into plants from the start, they are less expensive to install. The economy
and capability of cogeneration technology allows many plants to return
to burning coal without exceeding air-quality standards. &quot;Circulating
Fluidized-Bed&quot; boilers, &quot;Selective Catalytic (and Non-catalytic)
Reduction&quot;, and &quot;Zero-Discharge&quot; water treatment systems
are examples of technologies being used to control various environmental
problems. </P></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Combined-Cycle
and Biomass Plants</FONT></FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some natural gas plants can produce electricity without 
        steam. They use turbines very much like those on jet-aircraft. Instead 
        of burning jet-fuel and producing thrust, however, these units burn natural 
        gas and power a generator. Gas-turbine generators have been popular for 
        many years because they can be started quickly in response to temporary 
        demand surges for electricity. A newer twist is the &quot;Combined-Cycle&quot; 
        plant which uses gas-turbines in this fashion, but then channels the hot 
        exhaust gas to a boiler, which makes steam to turn another rotor. This 
        substantially improves the overall efficiency of the generating plant.

<P><A HREF="okeelnta.htm"><IMG SRC="img24.jpg" ALT="Okeelanta Biomass Power Plant" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=255 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>In addition to these innovations some thermal plants are being designed to
burn &quot;biomass.&quot; <I>(Shown is a biomass plant in Florida,

or some other renewable plant material. For example, Okeelanta Cogeneration
Plant in Florida burns bagasse waste from surrounding sugar-cane processing
operations during one part of the year, and waste wood during the growing
season.</P></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Nuclear
Plants</FONT></FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although there are some important technical (and social) 
        differences, nuclear power stations are thermal plants that make electricity 
        in much the same way as fossil-fuel plants. The difference is that they 
        generate steam by using the heat of atomic fission rather than by burning 
        coal, oil, or gas. The steam then turns a generator as in other thermal 
        plants.<a name="gen4"></a></FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="nuke1.htm"><IMG SRC="hq1.jpg" ALT="Diagram of a Nuclear Plant" HEIGHT=211 WIDTH=450></a></P><A HREF="nuke1.htm">

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><I>Diagram of a Nuclear plant in the Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec
system<BR>
copyright, Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec</I></FONT></P></A>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Nuclear plants don't use large amounts of fuel and do not refuel often, unlike a coal plant which must have train-loads
of fuel shipped in regularly. The fact that green-house gasses and air-borne particulates
are minimal during normal operation makes nuclear power attractive to many who are concerned about air-quality. Waste water
is hotter than that from a fossil plant, and large cooling towers are designed to address this problem.</font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>However, the drive to field nuclear
power in the US faltered in the face of public concerns over safety, environmental, and economic issues.
As more safety mechanisms were specified, construction costs and system
complexities grew. Also, plants have shown some unexpected quirks, such as boiler tubes wearing out prematurely. Nuclear engineers contend that early problems with nuclear
plants are subject to technical fixes, and are working on new &quot;inherently
safe&quot; plant designs. Opponents argue that simply using uranium and
plutonium as fuel creates too many problems and risks, not worth any benefits the technology
might have.</P>

<P>So far, one problem which has not
been solved is that of disposing of spent fuel cores and contaminated accessories
which may remain dangerous for thousands of years. Permanent burial in
geologically stable locations is the plan being pursued at this time, though
this is still very controversial.</P>

<P>High-profile accidents at Three Mile
Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 were, for
the nuclear industry, public-relation disasters. Continuing economic problems have made nuclear plants much less attractive investments. Even though it produced 22% of America's electricity
in 1996, nuclear power's future in this country is uncertain and hotly debated.</P></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+2>Kinetic
Generating Plants</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hydro-electric plants and wind-mills
also convert energy into electricity. Instead of heat energy, they use
kinetic energy, or the energy of motion. Moving wind or water (sometimes
referred to as &quot;white coal&quot;) spins a turbine, which in turn spins
the rotor of a generator. Since no fuel is burned, no air pollution is
produced. Wind and water are renewable resources and, while there have
been many recent technical innovations, we have a long history of harnessing
these energy sources. Problems exist even with these technologies, however.</FONT></P>
<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Hydro-electric
Plants</FONT></FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Two basic types of hydro-electric plants are in service. 
        One type, a &quot;run-of-river&quot; plant, takes energy from a fast moving 
        current to spin the turbine. The flow of water in most rivers can vary 
        widely depending on the amount of rain-fall. Hence, there are few suitable 
        sites for run-of-river plants.<a name="gen5"></a></font></P>
      <FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>Most <A HREF="hydro.htm"><U>hydro-electric
plants</U></A> use a reservoir to compensate for periods of drought, and to
boost water-pressure in the turbines. These man-made lakes cover large
areas, often creating picturesque sport and recreational facilities. The massive dams
required are also handy for controlling floods. In the past, few questioned
the common assumption that the benefits outweighed the costs.</P>

<P>These costs stem from the loss of land
submerged by the reservoir. Dams have displaced people, and destroyed wild-life
habitat and archeological sites. A dam-burst can be disasterous. Some environmental
costs can be avoided by thoughtful design; using fish-ladders to permit
fish to travel around a dam is one good example. However, other costs remain,
and protests against some recent hydro-power projects have become as angry
as anti-nuclear protests.</P>

<P>A special type of hydro-power is called
&quot;Pumped Storage&quot;. Some non-hydro plants can take advantage of
periods of low demand (and low costs) by pumping water into a reservoir.
When demand rises, some of this water is channeled through a hydro-turbine
to generate electricity. Since &quot;peak-load&quot; generating units (used
to meet temporary demand surges), are generally more expensive to run than
&quot;base-load&quot; units (which run most of the time), pumped-storage
is one way to boost system efficiency.</P></FONT>
<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Wind
Power</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wind-farms do not need reservoirs and
create no air pollution. Small wind-mills can provide power to individual
homes. Air carries much less energy than water, however, so much more of
it is needed to spin rotors. One needs either a few very large wind-mills
or many small ones to operate a commercial wind-farm. In either case, construction
costs can be high.</font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>Like run-of-river hydro-plants, there
are a limited number of suitable locations where the wind blows predictably.
Even in such sites, turbines often have to be designed with special gearing so that the rotor will turn at a constant speed in
spite of variable wind speeds. Some find less technical problems
with installations that can turn a scenic ridge or pass into an ugly steel
forest, or that can take a toll on birds.</P></FONT>
<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+2>Alternative
Generation</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Other types of power plants do not
use traditional equipment to produce electricity. Geo-thermal plants replace
boilers with the Earth itself. Photo-voltaics (&quot;PV&quot;) and Fuel
Cells go further by dispensing with turbo-generators entirely. These alternate
energy technologies have been under development for several decades, and
advocates believe the technical and political situation will now bring
them into the market-place.</FONT></P>
<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Geothermal
Plants</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Pressure, radioactive decay, and underlying
molten rock make the deep places in the Earth's crust hot indeed. A vivid
example of the heat available underground is seen when geysers erupt, sending
steam and hot water high in the air. Natural sources of steam and hot water
have attracted the attention of power engineers since early in this century.</font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>By tapping this naturally-created thermal
energy, geothermal plants provide electricity with low levels of pollution.
There are several different varieties of plants, and the product from a
geothermal site is used for heating as well as electricity production.
Finding suitable sites can be difficult, although as technical innovations
occur, more sites are made practical. Tapping geothermal sources can also
have the effect of &quot;turning off&quot; natural geysers, and this possibility
must be taken into account during the planning stage.</P></FONT>
<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Solar
Power</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Solar-cells or &quot;photo-voltaics&quot;
do not use a generator; they are the generator. Usually arranged in panels,
these devices take advantage of the ability of light to cause a current
to flow in some substances. A series of cells are wired together and the
current flows from the panel when sunlight strikes it. They produce no
pollution when operating, and most scientists predict that the fuel supply
will last at least 4 billion years.</font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>Solar panels have been relatively expensive
to make, and of course they won't work at night or in foul weather. Some
of the processes needed to manufacture them have recently been called into question environmentally. Not all of the sunlight striking a solar cell is converted into
electricity, and boosting efficiency has been slow work. Yet, the idea
of harnessing all of that free sunlight remains a powerful driver for solar
power.</P></FONT>
<A NAME="toc12"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Fuel
Cells</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Valued for their usefulness on space-craft,
fuel cells combine substances chemically to generate electricity. While
this might sound very similar to a battery, fuel-cells are powered by a
continuous flow of fuel. In the US Space Shuttle, for example, fuel cells
combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce water and electricity. </font></P><FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>Fuel cells have generally been expensive
to make and not well suited to large installations. However, they represent
a &quot;modular&quot; technology in that capacity can be added in small
increments (5 - 20MW) as needed, allowing utilities to reduce both capital
expenditures and construction lead times. Research seems to show promise; one test installation in Yonkers, NY, can produce 200kw by using gas created in the operations of a wastewater treatment plant. Also, fuel-cell plants are being used for central power in Japan. </P></FONT>
<A NAME="toc13"></A>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>Decentralized Generation</FONT></FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The ultimate usefulness of fuel-cells or photo-voltaics 
        may not lie with large central generating plants. In the era before great 
        continent-spanning networks of wires, a small generating station on the 
        premises made economic sense for many business and industrial power users. 
        As motors and equipment were improved and designed to take advantage of 
        the new energy supply, more customers electrified their businesses and 
        homes.<a name="gen6"></a></font></P>
      <FONT FACE="Arial">

<P>In the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> Century,
small generating companies consolidated and <A HREF="edison.htm"><U>independent
plants</U></A> slowly disappeared. It simply became more economical to purchase
power from a centrally-located utility rather than generate it on-site.
Large regional power pools grew, as companies interconnected their transmission
systems and shared reserve capacity. &quot;Economy of Scale&quot; became
the watch-words.</P>

<P>This may change in the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
Century. As the technology of electrical generation improves, and environmental
concerns rise, the very concept of large centralized generating stations
is coming into question. In most cases, for example, it is not economical
to heat homes and businesses from a central location. Individual furnaces
provide heat for separate buildings, with fuel provided by an associated
transportation and distribution systems. Gasoline or diesel powered generators
provide decentralized power to buildings in emergencies, though they are
not economical for full-time power. Continued technical improvements in
fuel-cells or photo-voltaics may change these economics. This possibility
is especially attractive considering the cost of and objections to building
large power lines.</P></FONT>
