      Book of Five Rings (Gorin no sho)</i> by Miyamoto Musashi</font></font></font></b> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The<i> Book of Five Rings (Gorin no 
        sho)</i>, similar to other pre-modern East Asian philosophical texts, 
        is comprised of brief passages under headings that deal with different 
        issues.&nbsp; Written by Miyamoto Musashi, a swordsman of mythical proportions, 
        the book serves as a guide to both the martial arts and military strategy.&nbsp; 
        In this ìguide,ÅEhowever, Musashi rarely goes into specific details on 
        techniques or actual tactics but rather gives advice on the general picture 
        of how one should react in a given situation. The booksÅEformat and ambiguities 
        might be compared to Sun Tzuís <i>Art of War</i>, another book on military 
        strategy from the East Asian tradition.</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The<i> Book of Five Rings </i>and 
        Zen Buddhism</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Zen Buddhism had a great influence 
        on Musashiís teachings.&nbsp; Indeed, the austerity and simplicity in 
        his teachings are similar to the doctrines of Zen.&nbsp; Musashi insisted 
        that knowledge is full circle, meaning that the most elementary teachings 
        are also the more important.&nbsp; The last chapter of the book, the ìScroll 
        of Emptiness,ÅEemphasizes the importance of understanding and recognizing 
        the existence of nothingness.&nbsp; For in order to focus the mind completely 
        on the attainment of the way, one must be free from the distractions of 
        worldly matters.&nbsp; Ultimately then, the sword becomes ìno swordÅEas 
        one is able to see the way of other things through the way of the warrior.</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The<i> Book of Five Rings </i>and 
        Japanís Economic Boom</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The <i>Book of Five Rings </i>has attracted 
        a great deal of attention<i> </i>as some sort of salarymanís bible.&nbsp; 
        Some have attributed Japanís economic boom during the 70ís and 80ís to 
        the bushid&ocirc; legacy.&nbsp; And consequently, the <i>Book of the Five 
        Rings</i> has been credited with playing a role in developing both corporate 
        strategy and the single-mindedness of Japanese white-collar types.&nbsp; 
        In fact, Musashi did deal with the subject of moneymaking directly in 
        his work.&nbsp; For example, in the chapter titled ìGround Book,ÅEMusashi 
        wrote that the ìway of the merchantÅEis ìalways to live by taking profit.ÅE/font></font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Miyamoto Musashi</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shinmen Musashi no Kami Fujiwara no 
        Genshin, or as he is more commonly known to Japanese, Miyamoto Musashi 
        (1584-1645), was born to a family of powerful samurai retainers.&nbsp; 
        His mother died when he was very young, and his father abandoned him soon 
        after, so he was brought up by relatives.&nbsp; Dedicated to <i>kend&ocirc;</i> 
        at a very early age, young Musashi was said to have killed a man for the 
        first time at age thirteen.&nbsp; The combative Musashi found abundant 
        opportunities to hone his skill, having been born in the midst of the 
        unification campaigns first undertaken by the powerful daimyo warlord, 
        Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp; With more than sixty duels under his belt by the time 
        he was twenty-nine, Musashi decided to abandon real swords once and for 
        all and fashioned a wooden sword instead.&nbsp; By the time he was fifty-five, 
        Musashi understood the way of strategy.&nbsp; He lived out his final years 
        in a cave, away from luxury, where he wrote the <i>Book of Five Rings</i>.</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">English Translations</font></b> 
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are four different English translations 
        of Miyamoto Musashiís <i>Book of Five Rings </i>available.&nbsp; Each 
        is listed below with some brief comments on the comparative strengths 
        and weaknesses of the various translations.</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>A Book of Five Rings: A Guide 
        to Strategy</i> translated by Victor Harris (Woodstock: The Overlook Press, 
        1974)</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">This version does an excellent job 
        of situating Musashi in a historical context.&nbsp; The book begins with 
        a fascinating piece about Japan during Musashiís lifetime, including a 
        discussion about the political system and the unification process that 
        was about to change Japan.&nbsp; The next section is a biography of Musashi 
        with interesting anecdotes about his various duels.&nbsp; Portraits of 
        Musashi, pictures of swords he used, and paintings by Musashi appear throughout 
        the book.&nbsp; Not coincidentally, the author/translator is a curator 
        at the British museum and an authority on Japanese swords.&nbsp; The translation 
        of the work itself is easy to understand and provides footnotes for Japanese 
        terms that appear in the text.</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>The Book of Five Rings</i> translated 
        by Thomas Cleary (Boston &amp; London: Shambhala, 1993)</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">This edition, from Buddhist scholar 
        Thomas Cleary contains disappointingly little on the historical background 
        of Musashi and his times.&nbsp; The lack of any interesting pictures, 
        maps, or footnotes also make reading this book a rather dry experience 
        on the whole. The translation, however, is easily readable, and he avoids 
        using any Japanese terms.&nbsp; Perhaps his goal was to make the text 
        as easy to read as possible.&nbsp; The small label, ìBusiness/ Martial 
        Arts,ÅEappears on the back cover, suggesting that the book might be for 
        businessmen who do not have the time or inclination to learn more about 
        Japanese history and culture.&nbsp; Clearyís biggest contribution is his 
        ability to make abstract religious concepts understandable to the reader.&nbsp; 
        This is especially important in the final chapter of the work, the ìBook 
        of Emptiness,ÅE which is regarded as the chapter most heavily influenced 
        by Musashiís Zen Buddhist background.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider the following passage in 
        the Harris translation: ìWhat is called the spirit of the void is where 
        there is nothing.&nbsp; It is not included in manís knowledge.&nbsp; Of 
        course the void is nothingness.&nbsp; By knowing things that exist, you 
        can know that which does not exist.&nbsp; That is the void.ÅEnbsp; Cleary 
        translates these esoteric concepts in a more comprehensible way: ìThe 
        meaning of emptiness is that the realm where nothing exists, or cannot 
        be known, is seen as empty.&nbsp; Of course, emptiness does not exist.&nbsp; 
        Knowing of nonexistence while knowing of existence is emptiness.ÅEnbsp; 
        Cleary gives the reader a better chance of understanding the material 
        in this difficult chapter.</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>The Book of Five Rings: The 
        Real Art of Japanese Management </i>translated by Nihon Services Corporation: 
        Bradford J. Brown, Yuko Kashiwagi, William H. Barrett, and Eisuke Sasagawa 
        (New York: Bantam Books, 1982)</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">This translation, as its title suggests, 
        seems to promise businessmen a fast track up the corporate ladder through 
        understanding the secrets of Eastern mysticism.&nbsp; The cover features 
        a salaryman and a samurai standing opposite each other in a similar pose, 
        suggesting some sort of equivalency between the two figures.&nbsp; Despite 
        its kitschy appearance, the translation is not as bad as might be expected.&nbsp; 
        A short commentary precedes every scroll in the book, summarizing the 
        contents of each scroll.&nbsp; Their language, however, is rather awkward, 
        and they are not all that helpful.&nbsp; The translation itself is more 
        readable, but the wording is slightly clumsy, and the translators fail 
        to provide explanatory footnotes for Japanese terms.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider the following excerpt: ìIn 
        Heiho as it pertains to large numbers, it is important to chase the opponent 
        so as not to lose the moment afforded by seizing the rhythm of the opponentís 
        collapse.&nbsp; If you lose the moment afforded by the opponentís collapse, 
        the opponent may recover.ÅEnbsp; In the Harris book, this excerpt is translated 
        in a more succinct and fluid manner: ìIn large-scale strategy, when the 
        enemy starts to collapse you must pursue him without letting the chance 
        go.&nbsp; If you fail to take advantage of your enemiesÅEcollapse, they 
        may recover.ÅEnbsp; The repetitiveness and wordiness in the Nihon ServicesÅE 
        translation can be tedious for the reader.&nbsp; This translation does 
        seem to offer a more literal translation (which would probably explain 
        the clumsy and repetitive wording).</font> 
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Martial Artistís Book of Five 
        Rings: The Definitive Interpretation of Miyamoto Musashiís Classic Book 
        of Strategy translated by Steve Kaufman (Rutland, VT: Charles E. Tuttle, 
        1999)</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Steve Kaufman, a karate expert living 
        in New York City, has produced a responsible translation of Miyamoto Musashiís 
        classic.&nbsp; Although there is little in terms of historical context 
        and background, Kaufman does an excellent job of translating the text.&nbsp; 
        Not as concise as HarrisÅEtranslation, Kaufman nonetheless avoids the 
        wordiness of the Nihon ServicesÅEversion.&nbsp; Kaufman points out in 
        his introduction that ìthis is not another book about Japanese business 
        strategy,ÅEpointing to the obvious, yet often ignored, difference between 
        ìnot getting a deal signed and having your head cut off.ÅEnbsp; It would 
        be safe to assume then, that Kaufman would not be too pleased to learn 
        that the back cover of the book has ìMartial Arts/ BusinessÅEwritten on 
        it.&nbsp; Aimed at ìmartialistsÅE(not to be confused, Kaufman adds, with 
        martial-artists, for the concept of ìartÅEin the context of battle can 
        be problematic), the book conveys a vital sense of physicality in its 
        writing.&nbsp; This version pays additional attention to passages that 
        discuss individual combat.&nbsp; As compared to other translations, Kaufman 
        goes into much more detail when discussing the ìmartialistÅEmaterial in 
        the book.</font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the section titled ìHolding the 
        Long Sword,ÅEKaufman gives a very descriptive account on how the swordsman 
        should conduct himself: ìIt is important for you to understand the proper 
        manner in which to hold the long sword.&nbsp; The grip should be both 
        loose and tight at the same time.&nbsp; What I mean by this is that you 
        should hold the sword firmly and resolutely, yet at the same time your 
        hand and wrist must be pliable.&nbsp; Hold the sword as you would a fishing 
        rod and strike with it as if you were casting a fish line.&nbsp; Hold 
        the sword tightly with the bottom two fingers to give yourself the added 
        support you need to wield the long sword correctly. Direct the sword with 
        your thumb and forefingerÅE&nbsp; Kaufmanís long-winded translation contrasts 
        sharply with HarrisÅEbrevity as he omits the first half of the passage: 
        ìGrip the long sword with a rather floating feeling in your thumb and 
        forefinger, with the middle finger neither tight nor slack, and with the 
        last two fingers tight.&nbsp; It is bad to have play in your hands.ÅEnbsp; 
        Overall, Kaufmanís translation comes out sounding precisely like it was 
        written by the man he claims to be, one who has practiced karate for over 
        forty years and studied the ìringsÅEfor another ten.</font>
